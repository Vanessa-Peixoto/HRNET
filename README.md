# Project 14 - HRNET

## Project (fictional situation)

You work for the technology department of a large financial company, WealthHealth.
This company uses an internal web application, called HRnet, which manages employee records.
The app is old and uses jQuery on the front end, leading to considerable bugs and increased complaints internally.
Management is FINALLY going to let us update HRnet and convert it to React!
You will be one of the first developers to start converting code!
